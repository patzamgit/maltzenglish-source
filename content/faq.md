## General Information

{{% details summary="What is the EF Standard English Test?" %}}
The EF Standard English Test (EF SET) is a free, online English test designed to meet the high technical standards as the other standardized tests in the field, such as the TOEFL or IELTS.

With the EF Standard English Test, we set out to challenge the status quo – to build a testing solution that not only provides reliable measurement, but is also affordable, simple to use, and always accessible. It is the world’s first completely free standardized English test for learners of all levels, from beginner to advanced.

With completion of our 50-min EF SET, you will receive a breakdown of your Reading and Listening skills, and also an official EF SET Certificate URL. You can add your personalized URL to your LinkedIn profile or include on your CV. Our score scale, based on the CEFR, is internationally recognized - making it easy for you to share your results and prove your English learning achievements.

We also offer a 15-minute Quick Check which is a free and fast way for you to start with in getting an estimate of your English proficiency.

{{% details summary="Who built this test?" %}}
The EF SET was created by EF Education First with a team of language testing experts. Our advisory team has extensive experience in large-scale, standardized language assessment, drawing from previous work on TOEFL, IELTS, and TOEIC for other organizations such as Educational Testing Service (ETS) and The College Board.

Chief among these have been Lyle Bachman (UCLA) , author of Language Assessment in Practice (Oxford 2010), the initial design consultant; Ric Luecht and John Willse of the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, the psychometric consultants and data scientists; and Mari Pearlman (Pearlman Education Group), the lead test development and operations consultant. Nathan Carr and Yoko Ameriks have served as language assessment experts.
