                <h3>Why it's important to know your English level</h3>
		<p>The English level system you use to describe your English skills is usually imposed on you from the outside. An employer, a school, a teacher, or an immigration authority asks you to take a particular English test, so you do, and then you describe your English level using that test's system. Depending on your goals and location, you are likely to be more familiar with one system of English levels than another. For example, if you're applying to university in the USA, you probably know what a TOEFL score of 100 means, whereas if you're trying to get a visa to move to the UK, you're more likely to be familiar with the CEFR level B1.</p>
